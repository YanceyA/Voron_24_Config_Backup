# Repository Guidelines

This repository targets a Klipper printer running the Kalico fork. For the full hardware/architecture overview and configuration map, see `SYSTEM_DETAILS.md`.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`printer.cfg` is the root include file and should remain minimal; use `[include]` directives to pull in per-feature configs. Organize updates in the existing folders:
- `hardware/` holds board, sensor, and motion subsystem wiring.
- `macros/` contains grouped automation flows (`macros/Print`, `macros/Beacon`, etc.) and shared `variables.txt`.
- `features/` tracks optional Klipper modules (bed mesh, KAMP, ShakeTune) so they can be toggled by include order.
- `modules/` captures companion service configs (`KlipperScreen.conf`, `crowsnest.conf`).
- `config_backups/` and results folders (`adxl_results/`, `ShakeTune_results/`) store captured data; keep raw exports here, not in feature directories.
Respect the include globbing already declared in `printer.cfg` when adding new files.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `~/klipper/scripts/check_klippy.py printer.cfg` validates syntax and inclusion paths before you reload the printer.
- `~/klipper/scripts/calc_estimate.py -c printer.cfg` helps verify motion limits if you alter speeds/accelerations.
- `./autocommit.sh` backs up `~/printer_data/config`, captures Klipper/Moonraker versions, and pushes to the `main` branch.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the existing two-space indentation and align parameters on the same column where practical. Use lowercase snake case for sections and filenames (`heater_bed`, `park_bed.cfg`). Mirror Klipper option names exactly; add clarifying block comments in all-caps dividers (`#####################################################################`) if you introduce new subsystems. Store reusable constants under `[gcode_macro ...]` variables instead of duplicating values.

## Testing Guidelines
After validation, deploy with `RESTART` from the console and confirm `STATUS` reports clean load. For macros, run a dry-fire in `PRINT_START` or targeted macros with `FIRMWARE_RESTART` ready if something fails. Attach ADXL or ShakeTune captures to the matching results directory and mention the dataset name in your PR. Avoid editing the auto-generated `SAVE_CONFIG` blocks; instead rerun tuning commands and let Klipper rewrite them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Automated backups use the `Autocommit from <timestamp>` format; for manual work prefer `area: short imperative` (e.g., `macros: adjust purge sequence`). Provide a brief summary of changed files, a verification log (commands, macros exercised), and reference any issue or tune ID. Screenshots of UI changes or sensor plots help reviewers. Ensure PRs stay focusedâ€”split hardware, macro, and feature adjustments into separate branches when possible.
